Players take turns drawing a card from one of the three dificulty decks.
The player drawing the card has 70 seconds to draw as many of the 10 prompts as they can.
Once the timer is up, other players have to guess as many of the prompts as possible from the drawings.
The guesser is awarded a point for each correct guess.
Take turns drawing and guessing until a player reaches a point-threshhold of your choosing.
