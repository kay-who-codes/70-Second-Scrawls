Draw cards from one of the three dificulty decks.

You have 100 seconds to draw as many prompts as you can.

Once the timer is up, other players have to guess as many of the prompts as possible from your drawings.

The guesser is awarded a point for each correct guess.

Take turns drawing and guessing until a player reaches a point-threshhold of your choosing.
